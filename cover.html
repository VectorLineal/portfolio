				</h2>

				<p>Dear Mr Ripley.</p>
				<p>
					Currently I am looking forward to the intern <i class="fa fa-red">researcher</i> role as it would contribute to my professional formation and it <i class="fa fa-red">would</i> grant me an unique work experience, furthermore, I can prove or even improve my english level.</p>
				<p>
					My professional goals are aligned with this opportunity, I can develop my skills further as in this case I will be facing new professional challenges in a more real context than in an academic one. I am really interested in learning about new technologies and having the opportunity to use your exclusive Information and communication technologies infrastructure while I learn about it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Currently I am finishing a computer engineering degree and, as I see, it <i class="fa fa-red">is</i> the perfect moment to look forward to opportunities like this. My english level is outstanding and I am constantly willing to improve more and more each day. I don’t <i class="fa fa-red">have</i> accounted laboral experience, however, I’ve developed several apps for university projects, personal projects and even several hackathons or game jams. So, with that in mind, it could be said that I am good for working in teams and with limited time. I also quickly learn any topic necessary to complete a project and I am constantly looking for new technologies. In engineering you can never remain static. 
				</p>
				<p>I <i class="fa fa-red">keep</i> looking for new challenges, I don’t get bothered by having to research more in order to get better results and I even apply the assertive communications principles in order to improve my relationship with all the members of my team and the directive area of the project. I am able to solve complex mathematical and algorithmic problems using known algorithms or even my own solutions respecting computer performance or memory constraints, <i class="fa fa-red">also</i> in that aspect, I can manage to develop any software system project from the requirements recollection to the detailed design and architectural design to the implementation, testing and deployment of the system and continuous integration <i class="fa fa-red">with</i> DevOps.</p>
				<p>
					I <i class="fa fa-red">have</i> worked with cloud infrastructure like Amazon Web Services or Google cloud and Firebase, I am experienced with several programming languages and web development frameworks or even mobile development environments like in android or IOS. I have worked, overall, in backend development, but I can also handle myself as a frontend developer or even a full stack developer.
				</p>
				<p>
					I’d really like to be accepted in this role, I hope I soon can join the university and make this internship a great experience by contributing with my engineering faculties. I’d like to keep in touch and arrange the details of my interview. You can contact me via telephone number 3115070060 or via email <a href="niconobza@gmail.com">niconobza@gmail.com</a>.
				</p>
				<p>I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.<br/>
					<br/>
					Yours sincerely.<br/>
					<br/>
					Nicolás Nobza.
