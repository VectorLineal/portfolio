			<h1>Autobiography</h1>
				<p>My name is Juan Nicolás Nobza Acuña, I was born in Zipaquirá in July 20, 1999 and
				I’ve lived all my 21 years here in Zipaquirá. I studied in 5 schools before I finally
				graduated in 2016. The next year I joined <i class="fa fa-red">the</i> Universidad Nacional de Colombia
				to study computing engineering.</p>
				<p>
					I grew up in my grandparents’ house which was useful to my parents because they
					were most of the day working in Bogotá, but we never moved to Bogotá for
					economic reasons and we’ve always thought it’s too chaotic. My mother bought a
					piece of ground and finally, in 2008, we had our own house and moved there. Then
					in 2010 my parents separeted and I live only with my mother since then.
				</p>
				<p>
					My mother’s family is from Boyacá (a small rural city in the department of Boyaca)
					and my father’s family is from Girón, Santander. So in my childhood’s vacations I
					used to spend time in Boyacá or Girón. About Boyacá, I always liked the land,
					waterfalls, cats, crops, that kind of stuff, by the other hand, in Girón i liked to play
					with my cousins, one of my brothers lived there, althougth I’ve always lived alone
					with my parents or grandparents, except for a small period of time, when my
					brother graduated he moved to Zipaquirá to study chemical engineering in the
					Universidad Nacional and then he quited and moved to Bogota to finally move to
					Buenos Aires to become an actor. I have 3 brothers and a sister ,only from my
					father’s side, but I’ve only met 2 of them, the one I already talked about and my
					sister, she’s currently studying <i class="fa fa-red">law</i>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Initially I studied my elementary in Cogua, it’s like 40 minutes walking from my
					home, then I studied in Zipaquirá, then in Tenjo for 1 year and finally I graduated
					in Zipaquirá in 2016, so, as you may have noticed, I’m used to <i class="fa fa-red">commute</i> a lot
					including a daily travel to Bogotá for 4 hours a day.
				</p>
				<p>
					I end my studies this year, <i class="fa fa-red">next semester</i>, I’m currently planning my thesis
					and I’ve already been looking for a job. That’s one of the reasons to be in this
					course as a few months ago I had an interview in english with a hindu person and I
					realised my english speaking was kinda lame, so I’m looking forward to learn
					english exeptionally good and go to work abroad.
