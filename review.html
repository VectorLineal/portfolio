			<h1>Captain Fantastic Review</h1>
				<p>Captain Fantastic is a dramatic film which was directed by Matt Ross. It stars Vigo
					Mortensen , Frank Langella, Kathryn Hahn, and Steve Zahn. The film had its premiere
					in 2016 at the Sundance Film Festival.</p>
				<p>
					The film is set, in its first half, in the mountains where Ben and his family live isolated.
					The other half of the action is set in the big city, in the church and Leslie’s family’s
					houses.</p>
				<p>
					Ben Cash, his wife and their six children live in the countryside isolated from the rest of
					the world, but Ben’s wife, Leslie, suffers from a mental disease, she has terrible
					hallucinations and she cuts her own wrists to death. Her family hasn’t seen her in a
					long time and Leslie’s family has forbidden Ben to go to the christian funeral although
					Leslie’s <i class="fa fa-red">a</i> budhist and her last will is to be burned to a cinder and then be flushed into a
					toilet. In fact, Ben’s family is anarchic and Marxist, they don’t live by the same moral
					values as most people, they hunt their own meals, they train each day how to defend
					themselves, how to climb, etc. They don’t even go to school, Ben teaches them using
					his books to the point his eldest son has been accepted in several universities, it
					actually helps them a lot, but the world is not ready to accept them, they’re just “weird”
					for the rest of people and they must accomplish Leslie’s last will to honor her in this last
					moment.
				</p>
				<p>
					I definitely recommend this movie, but I also say this movie is not for everyone, I think
					some people may find it boring at times. It’s a movie made to reflect on how the world
					just casts some people apart, they try to make them like they think it’s correct even
					though they don’t live by the same standards. It’s a beautiful movie to watch with your
					family, especially with kids, it’d be an interesting topic for them to reflect as, in my
					case, at some point I managed to realise I inquired in some opresing ways to interact
					with “different” people.
