			<h1>Cinemas Vs. Movies at Home (opinion)</h1>
				<p><i class="fa fa-red">
					In the last years, with the arrival of streaming services where you can watch your favorite movies and series as long as you have internet connection,
					many people have asked themselves wether these new ways of entretainment will finish off the cinemas as a way to enjoy movies.
				</i></p>
				<p>
					I agree with the first part of the statement, it is indeed more convenient to watch a movie in the comfort of your home, and so it <i class="fa fa-red">has</i> been for a long time, since the video tapes and retransmissions on the TV have existed, however, as history has shown, the cinemas keep existing and being popular.</p>
				<p>
					So for the second part of the statement, I disagree because cinemas are more than just <i class="fa fa-red">watching</i> a movie, they are a whole different experience compared to watching films at home, there you have the big screen that may even be 3D or the incredible audio quality which is unmatched against the home cheap quality<i class="fa fa-red">. F</i>urthermore, the cinemas are a meeting point; there you can meet with your group of friends to watch the latest cinema listings or the awaited superhero movie and feel the hype within all your closest friends. It’s also common to meet with your love interest and share a good time at the cinema which is not as intimate for first dates as watching a film together at home.
				</p>
				<p>
					And finally, with the pandemic, it’s clear, at least in my experience, that people are willing to return to the cinemas, I could even say they’re craving to do so as I could notice living in Zipaquira and having the cinema opened way before than in Bogota. I told my Bogota friends that I had managed to watch Godzilla vs Kong at the Zipaquira’s cinema and their reactions consisted of their will to return to the cinemas as soon as possible.
